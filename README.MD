# ChatGPT-4 Web App

This is a ChatGPT clone that uses the GPT-4 model from OpenAI.
It allows you to chat with the model and see the results in real time.

The web app also allows for syntax highlighting on code blocks to make it easy to use and readable.

The web app uses a proxy server to make API calls using the OpenAI API
The repo for the server side code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/Giac3/freeGPT-server">Server</a>

## If you want to run this locally:

Clone the server-side linked above and run the following commands:
    
    npm install
    npm start

In the server side code you will need to specify your own OpenAI API key in a `.env` file.

Then Clone the front-end code and run the following commands:

    npm install
    npm run dev
